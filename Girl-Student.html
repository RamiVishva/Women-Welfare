      <h3>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao – MATRU VANDANA YATRA</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Gujarat is suffering from one of the worst outcomes of gender based discrimination, i.e. declining male-female sex ratio. The state average of child sex ratio (0-6 years) declined dramatically from 928 in 1991 to 878 in 2001. To address this
        issue various efforts are being made, one of the major being the ‘Beti Bachao Campaign’ that was launched by Honorable Chief Minister on the occasion of World Women’s Day in 2005. Gender Resource centre, an autonomous body, was an active
        partner of the campaign who was involved in documentation and publications with a realization that it could play a vital role in changing the perception of the society in general on such important issue.</p>
