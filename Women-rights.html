        working in groups, building team spirit, mobilization of activities, gaining knowledge and awareness to empower financially. This project is envisaged in 20 regions at 26 spots covering 1760 villages which include 43,200 women and 2700
        initiating helpers. This project has brought women into the mainstream of development in the rural areas of Gujarat.</p>

    <h3>Nari Adalat</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The concept devised ‘By women for women’ - the Nari Adalats is operational for legal justice in over 19 regions in Gujarat. Women jurists dispense justice in women’s cases of divorce, abandonment, violence, rape and dowry demands. These courts are set up for women empowerment and gender justice. These courts are not recognized by the State as a legal forum. However, the autonomous hybrid institutions are para legal authority who solve women cases faster than judicial courts. These courts are helping rural women overcome problems encountered in the normal judicial system. Inaccessibility, cost, time, unfamiliarity with legal procedures, inadequate resources, and a traditional disregard of the needs of women – all solutions get speedy, efficacy, and cost effective.</p>
